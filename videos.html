			Negative images of Africa dominate the news: famine and disease, conflict and corruption. But Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, the former Finance Minister of Nigeria and now a director of the World Bank, says there's a less-told story unfolding in many African nations: one of reform, economic growth and business opportunity. Cracking down on corruption -- and the perception of corruption -- will be the key to its success. She tells how high-ranking Nigerian officials taking money illicitly have been jailed, and how citizens and prospective business partners are getting at least a partial picture now of where money flows.

			This event will explore the next frontiers in responding to forced displacement and fragility: emerging challenges, priorities, and solutions. This will include new mechanisms—such as the World Bank's concessional financing for countries hosting refugees and compacts that bring together development and humanitarian investments—that can reshape the international response to protracted refugee crises.
